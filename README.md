# Brew & Beans - UI/UX Prototype

This repository contains a complete, production-ready set of static pages for a modern light-themed coffee shop website. It follows the provided architecture (MPA with the component breakdown) and utilizes Tailwind CSS via CDN for styling.

Key features:
- Mobile-first, responsive design
- Glassmorphism in header/footer
- IntersectionObserver-powered scroll/load animations
- Polished hover/focus states with smooth transitions
- Lightbox gallery, menu filters (static demo), and multi-page navigation

File structure mirrors the architecture plan, with reusable templates in /templates and partials in /partials. All pages are semantic HTML5 and accessible where practical.
